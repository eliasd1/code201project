## About Me

I built a website that quizzes a user about me and checks whether he/she got it correct. It responds with "correct" if the user guesses correctly, "wrong" if the user guesses incorrectly, and "not a valid input" if the input is not "y/yes or n/no". After completing the quiz, an html page loads with information about me, and at the bottom of the page there is a score counter which displays the number of correct answers the user got.

Reflections and Comments

I believe my issues with conditionals has been resolved. During this exercise, I did not encounter any problems with the logic used in the code. I did have to use two functions for the website, maybe there is a way of simplifying it.
